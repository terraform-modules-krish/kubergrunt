# Kubergrunt Support for EKS 1.19

**FriedCircuits** commented *Feb 22, 2021*

Today I tested a EKS upgrade to 1.19 as we are building a new cluster and wanted to test upgrading with Terraform. I noticed that kubergrunt generated the following  error.

`module.eks_cluster.null_resource.sync_core_components[0] (local-exec):  ERROR: 1.19 is not a supported version for kubergrunt eks upgrade. Please contact support@gruntwork.io for more info.`

I know that 1.19 is super new for AWS but what needs to be updated in Kubergrunt to support 1.19? 1.20 is also a few months away.

Thanks.

I was able to make the changes locally and test it with success. I used the versions from https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/update-cluster.html

I can do a PR shortly.
