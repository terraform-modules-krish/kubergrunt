# `helm deploy` is not idempotent

If `helm deploy` fails during a deployment, you can get into a state where it partially applied the work. Then, there is no way to pick it back up from where it left off.

I guess the command should also detect the presence of an existing Helm installation if it doesn't already and direct the user to undeploy it first.

Failing that there could be a `--force` switch that recreates the secrets as needed and other resources.

Helm features are removed, so this is no longer relevant.
