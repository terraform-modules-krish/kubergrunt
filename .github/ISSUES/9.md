# Helm tools: Consider separating managed namespace from tiller-namespace

**yorinasub17** commented *Jan 24, 2019*

Right now a lot of the helm features were built with tiller managing resources in the `tiller-namespace` that it was deployed to.

However, this is a potential risk because an admin user in the `tiller-namespace` can now bypass the authentication mechanisms of tiller by inheriting the `ServiceAccount`. The worse risk is where read only users can grab the `tiller-secret` to obtain the server side TLS certs, which can be used to successfully authenticate to Tiller due to the shared CA for server and client verification and then get write access.

To mitigate this, Tiller should be deployed into a separate namespace, which then manages resources in the main namespace. This way, read only users in the main namespace do not get tiller access unless they are also explicitly granted access to the tiller namespace.

In this model, granting access to tiller now comprises of:

- Getting client side certs for tiller.
- Getting read only access to the tiller pod to look up the network.

And the service account needs:

- R/W access to secrets in the tiller namespace
- R/W access to all resources in the main namespace

This is already done.
