# helm rotate command that rotates the certs

This command should:

- Generate a new CA
- Generate new server side certs and do an inplace update on the existing Secret for Tiller.
- Generate new client side certs for each client previously granted and do an inplace update on the existing Secret for Tiller.

this looks like an interesting issue. I'll try to create a PR for this issue.

Helm features are removed, so this is no longer relevant.
