# Allow kubergrunt to continue even when it can't verify load balancer state.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like a command line flag for `kubergrunt eks deploy` called something like `--ignore-loadbalancer-state`
The purpose of this flag is to prevent kubergrunt to fail even though it is not able to get the load balancer state. 
This can for instance happen if you have unused service Load Balancers in a Pending state in your cluster. 
In a perfect world, you would ask your cloud developers to remove services they no longer use, but that is not always possible, so it would be nice to have a administrator feature like `--ignore-loadbalancer-state` to keep kubergrunt doing node rollover, and not failing in those cases.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Ask cloud developers to ensure they have active and functioning service load balancers.

**Additional context**
This error can be seen with:

```
[] INFO[2023-02-07T16:04:11+01:00] Found 1 LoadBalancer services of 22 services in kubernetes.  name=kubergrunt
[] ERRO[2023-02-07T16:04:11+01:00] Error retrieving associated ELB names of the Kubernetes services.  name=kubergrunt

[] ERRO[2023-02-07T16:04:11+01:00] Either resume with the recovery file or terminate the new instances.  name=kubergrunt
```

I have already made a fix in a fork, but I will only feed that back to upstream if you agree this is a usable feature.
