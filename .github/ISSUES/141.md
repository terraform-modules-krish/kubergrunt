Hi, just trying this out for the first time today and ran into this error. 

```

```

The service is using the AWS ALB ingress controller. 

Please let me know if there's more info I can provide to help troubleshoot further.

This should be fixed in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt/releases/tag/v0.7.8 (binaries should show up in 15-30 mins)
