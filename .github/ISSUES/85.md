# Actively deregister instances from target groups during `eks deploy`

**yorinasub17** commented *Mar 16, 2020*

For people using in-cluster mechanisms to manage ELB attachments (e.g., aws-alb-ingress-controller), detaching instances from ASGs do not actually deregister the instances from the ELBs. This can be a source of downtime during the rollout procedure as instances need to fail the health checks before being dropped from the list, which means they can continue to get requests while the servers are being drained and shut down.
