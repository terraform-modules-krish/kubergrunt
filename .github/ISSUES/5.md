# Roll out cluster update command in kubergrunt should validate PodDisruptionBudgets

**yorinasub17** commented *Jan 14, 2019*

Currently `kubergrunt` does not implement any checks for minimal downtime features to be implemented on the Kubernetes resources deployed on the cluster. As part of the rollout command, we should validate that the disruption control features (readiness probes and Pod Disruption Budgets) are implemented on the deployed resources before continuing with the rollout.

Implementation idea, use a new flag like `eks deploy --with-validation`, to ensure that deploy will respect downtime features (like readiness probes and Pod Disruption Budgets). If none of these are set, and `--with-validation` is given, it should interrupt the command with a warning and ask if you want to proceed.
