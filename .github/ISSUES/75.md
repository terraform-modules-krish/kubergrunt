# Tiller-less version

Could we make tiller deprecated or at least optional?

No need for it on Helm 3.

As far as I know, for helm 3, the whole feature set of `kubergrunt helm` is unnecessary and thus not needed.

Is there a specific command that you think is usable with `kubergrunt` and "helm 3" that needs updates?

No, sorry, I actually misunderstood kubergrunt purpose/behaviour. Silly me, kinda late in here.
