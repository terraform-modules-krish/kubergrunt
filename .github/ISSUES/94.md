# Cannot build: vbom.ml domain no longer exists

**herbygillot** commented *Sep 16, 2020*

The `vbom.ml` domain is currently down.  As a result, fetching dependencies fails for: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt/blob/47fda9d956bedcdfa6cda795695de6283f45f506/Gopkg.lock#L1294

```
(17/92) Failed to write github.com/ghodss/yaml@v1.0.0
grouped write of manifest, lock and vendor: error while writing out vendor tree: failed to write dep tree: failed to export vbom.ml/util: unable to deduce repository and source type for "vbom.ml/util": unable to read metadata: unable to fetch raw metadata: failed HTTP request to URL "http://vbom.ml/util?go-get=1": Get "http://vbom.ml/util?go-get=1": dial tcp: lookup vbom.ml: no such host

```

Seeing that it should be replaced with: https://github.com/fvbommel/util

This is now fixed in the latest `master` branch, where we have switched to go modules.
