# No --version flag when building from source

**sre-ops** commented *Aug 20, 2021*

Hi All,

When following the directions to build from source, the resultant binary does not have the --version flag available.  This causes downstream problems when working with other gruntworks modules, as most modules check the version of kubergrunt before using.  I am compiling with:

go build -o bin/kubergrunt ./cmd

Is there another flag or build config that I should use to make sure the --version flag gets included in kubergrunt?

For reference, here is the error encountered with kubergrunt built from latest source:

```
$ /usr/bin/kubergrunt --version
Incorrect Usage. flag provided but not defined: -version
Usage: kubergrunt [--loglevel] [--help] command [options] [args]

Ah you need to pass in the ldflags to set the version at build time. The following should work:

```
go build -o kubergrunt -ldflags "-X main.VERSION=v0.7.6 -extldflags '-static'" ./cmd
```

We need to update the docs to mention this.
