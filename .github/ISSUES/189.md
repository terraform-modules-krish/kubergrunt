# Document a list of kubergrunt versions compatible with k8s versions

**pras111gw** commented *Mar 17, 2023*

Describe the solution you'd like
Kubergrunt versions are updated when support for newer k8s versions are released in terraform-aws-eks module. As both release frequently, we need a compatibility chart so customers can pin versions accordingly.

Describe alternatives you've considered
This info is available in Kubergrunt release notes, but customers may find it easier to see a compatibility chart.

Additional context
This question was asked in a support ticket.
