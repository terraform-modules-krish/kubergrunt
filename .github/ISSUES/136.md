Per:

The currently supported release for 1.18 EKS cluters is:

1.18.8-eksbuild.1

1.18.8-eksbuild.2 doesn't exist and throws:
Failed to pull image "602401143452.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/eks/kube-proxy:v1.18.8-eksbuild.2": rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Error response from daemon: manifest for 602401143452.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/eks/kube-proxy:v1.18.8-eksbuild.2 not found: manifest unknown: Requested image not found

This should be fixed in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt/releases/tag/v0.7.7 (binaries should show up shortly)

AWESOME :) I like that not only was the issue fixed, it was done in such a way that actually goes beyond "here's a fixed list on the docs" but actually queries ECR!  Great work! :)
