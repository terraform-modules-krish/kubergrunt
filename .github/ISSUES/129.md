# CoreDNS 1.8.3 update requires clusterrole patch

**gaba-mlindner** commented *Jun 11, 2021*

I just upgraded my lab EKS cluster (managed by Gruntwork's `terraform-aws-eks` modules) from 1.19 to 1.20 and ran into some issues with kubergrunt's CoreDNS update.

After the module's provisioner had executed `eks sync-core-components ..`, DNS resolution inside the cluster stopped working and the new CoreDNS pods starting logging errors like:
```
E0611 10:20:52.181166       1 reflector.go:138] pkg/mod/k8s.io/client-go@v0.20.2/tools/cache/reflector.go:167: Failed to watch *v1beta1.EndpointSlice: failed to list *v1beta1.EndpointSlice: endpointslices.discovery.k8s.io is forbidden: User "system:serviceaccount:kube-system:coredns" cannot list resource "endpointslices" in API group "discovery.k8s.io" at the cluster scope
```

Quick googling led me to AWS' docs (see step 5):
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-coredns.html#updating-coredns-add-on

It turns out that the CoreDNS 1.8.3 update requires additional permissions.

Manually patching the `system:coredns` clusterrole resolved my issues, but I think it would make sense to have `kubergrunt` handle this kind of thing automatically (since it's already patching the image version and configmap anyways).

versions:
terraform `v1.0.0`
terragrunt `v0.29.2`
kubergrunt `v0.7.1`
terraform-aws-eks `v0.41.0`

Just FYI, I upgraded another cluster with the v0.7.2 version last night and it worked like a charm without manual intervention. Thanks for the quick fix!
