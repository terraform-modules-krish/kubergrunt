# Support for new regions: ECR repo 

**rajkz** commented *Apr 4, 2023*

**Describe the bug**
When we deploy [AWS Amazon EKS add-ons] to the cluster, Terragrunt modules are not able to pull & push images from Amazon ECR private registry in newer regions. This is because the newer regions are not added to the supported list in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt/blob/main/eks/sync.go

**To Reproduce**
Terragrunt version: v0.36.10
Kubergrunt version: v0.9.3

Steps to reproduce : 
Try to install an add on eks cluster in region: ap-southeast-3

```
resource "aws_eks_addon" "vpc-cni" {
  cluster_name = var.cluster_name
  addon_name   = "vpc-cni"
  addon_version  = var.vpc_cni_addon_version
  resolve_conflicts = "OVERWRITE"
}
```

**Expected behavior**
The Add Ons should be installed without any issues. Terragrunt should pick the correct ECR repo id for new regions
