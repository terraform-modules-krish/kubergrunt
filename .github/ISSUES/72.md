# Add support for multiple ASGs in rolling deployment command

**mikeandersen** commented *Oct 7, 2019*

Currently, `kubergrunt` requires a single `--asg-name` when running `eks deploy` but in many clusters you'll have multiple ASGs for your worker nodes.

It would be great if this supported providing a list of ASGs and running rolling deployments on each of them.

Yes, I ran into this issue too -- problem is running one asg-name does not work in a multi-load balancer scenario because kubergrunt tries to get all the load balancers. Another issue is if you have a cluster autoscaler, it will kill any extra nodes that kubergrunt creates to bring the system back to nominal.
