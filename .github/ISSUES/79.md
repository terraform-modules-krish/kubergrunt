# Add support for Google Kubernetes Engine

**g3kk0** commented *Feb 4, 2020*

This tool looks great! Unfortunately our platform is hosted on Google :-(

Would be great if support was added for Google Kubernetes Engine too.

Thanks for the comment. We don't have plans in the short term to enhance the GKE functionality because we've found GKE to have a lot more support for the basics than EKS. With that said, if you have specific use cases and functionalities with working with GKE that you'd like a tool like `kubergrunt` to support, let us know in this issue thread and we can see what we can implement!

Hi @g3kk0, it depends on your specific use-case, but we actually do have examples that use `kubergrunt` with GKE. e.g: We use `kubergrunt` here to configure TLS: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-gke/blob/master/main.tf#L290
