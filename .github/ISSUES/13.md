# Should we embed helm directly to avoid depending on helm client to reduce one more install?

**yorinasub17** commented *Jan 31, 2019*

Right now users of our module will need to install:

- kubectl
- helm client
- kubergrunt

Can we embed the helm client into kubergrunt to drop one more tool?

Some things to consider:

- How do we ensure we can support multiple Tiller versions?
- Do we have a moving target problem, where kubergrunt needs to be updated everytime helm updates?

Some mitigation methods:

- Can we ship multiple versions of `kubergrunt`, for each version of helm? E.g we support the last 3 feature releases, and ship `kubergrunt` binaries for the latest patch release of each one.
- Can we implement a version updater/checker that detects when the Tiller version diverges from the client and suggest upgrades and auto update itself?

Can we also add a command to kubergrunt that prints the local Helm client version & Tiller server version? You might be able to expose it all in a general `kubergrunt version` command.

Helm features are removed, so this is no longer relevant.
