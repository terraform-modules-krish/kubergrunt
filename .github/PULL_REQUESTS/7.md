__~Depends on https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt/pull/8~ MERGED__

This implements the `helm grant` and `helm configure` subcommands which can be used to grant and configure a local helm client to access the specified helm server install in the target Kubernetes namespace.

From 1:1 with Jim. Aim for ideal experience:
- `configure` => Output config file
- `kubergrunt helm` => Sets the environment variables to call to helm
- Make sure to document what it is doing
- Look into adding config file to helm directly
   - helm plugin
   - slack to ask thoughts
   - open github issue

Additional notes:
- not everyone has bash chops so env / aliasing may not be great as a default option
- Does env sourcing work with windows?

Re: config file - I found [a github issue in helm](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/4491) on this topic (the OP is completely unrelated, but the discussion evolved to be about config files) and it looks like this will be a helmv3 feature. In that case, I might just stick with the env var style approach, and update this when helmv3 lands.

PS: I found a way to do this in Powershell and Windows Cmd: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20077820/how-can-i-source-variables-from-a-bat-file-into-a-powershell-script/20078095#20078095. We could detect the OS as part of the command and create the relevant files.

Ok the latest version has been verified to work with https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-kubernetes-helm/pull/9, so I am going to merge this and release.
