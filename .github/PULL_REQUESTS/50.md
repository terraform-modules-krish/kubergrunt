# Add helm revoke functionality

**bwhaley** commented *May 21, 2019*

Hi team, this PR adds the `kubergrunt helm revoke` feature to `kubergrunt`. I've started by updating `README.md` with clarity on precisely what this feature does (and does not do). Does this seem along the lines of what we'd want for this feature?

@yorinasub17 @brikis98 @josh-padnick It seems a consensus has been reached that the grant/revoke process needs more rigorous testing. To do so, I can refactor the role/rolebinding operations to mirror how secrets are handled (e.g. via functions in the `kubectl` package as opposed to in `helm`). Then I'll write tests for role/rolebindings and for grant/revoke operations as per comments above. How does this sound?

That sounds good to me!

This most recent commit turns out to be fairly involved. Note that it's a WIP - still need to add tests and do a bit of clean up - but I'm interested in hearing if this is heading in the right direction. The tests are passing. I believe I've prevailed in an intense battle with the dependency snarl of helm, terratest, and kubernetes. Feedback on this WIP is welcome.

Also just wanted to let you know that I will be out the next two days so won't be able to check in on further updates until next Tuesday when I am back. Sorry about that, and really appreciate your contribution so far!

Feel free to hand off to me if you run out of time. I will be happy to take this further and get it merged once I'm back.

Just pushed my latest changes per feedback above. Sadly I'm out of time to spend on this, but hopefully it's in a pretty decent place and can be easily merged from here. Thanks for all the feedback and review.

Thanks for your hard work @bwhaley ! I took on the torch and made a few polishing touches to take this across the finish line. You can see my commits on https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt/pull/50/ for the changes I made.
