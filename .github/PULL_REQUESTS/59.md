# Add KUBECONFIG environment variable to kubeconfig flag

**KyleMartin901** commented *Aug 13, 2019*

This commit adds the environment variable KUBECONFIG to the KubeconfigFlags in the eks, helm, k8s and tls packages.

Adding the EnvVar means the precedence will follow as per the [urfave/cli package](https://github.com/urfave/cli#precedence)

1. Command line flag value from user
2. Environment variable
3. Default (As specified in the function KubeConfigPathFromHomeDir)

This closes #58

I haven't updated the README as it didn't have any reference to the kubeconfig flags. Would you like to see it somewhere so it is easy to see the precedence that the values have now.

The new output for the kubconfig flag is as follows which now includes the environment variable

```bash
 --kubeconfig value   The path to the kubectl config file to use to authenticate with Kubernetes. (default: "~/.kube/config") [$KUBECONFIG]
```

Yep I will attempt to get it done tonight.

Would you like me to also create the KUBECONTEXT environment variable?

@yorinasub17 To be able to modify cli.FlagEnvHinter it required me to update the package version so I added it as a second commit just incase you didn't want to upgrade. 

I didn't add the $ to the front of the environment variable in the usage description text due to Windows using `%KUBECONFIG%` rather than `$KUBECONFIG` thought try and be inclusive ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

I can also confirm I am using it with setting the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable and it works like a charm üëå
