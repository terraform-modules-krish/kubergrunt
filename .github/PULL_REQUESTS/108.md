# Patch for helm 2 compatibility

**yorinasub17** commented *Jan 7, 2021*

This is a patch to `v0.5.13` to be compatible with the new location of the helm stable repository for customers who are still on Helm v2.

> What is a hot patch?

Renamed to just patch. It was habit from my old days on running applications, where you would call a critical bug fix a "hot patch" as something that needs to go out fast. Technically, a hot patch is a patch that is applied to a running system which made sense in the context of a web app, but obviously makes no sense here.

Ahh, gotcha. That was the context in which I was familiar with the term but wasn't sure if there was an adaptation or alternative usage. Got it.

Customer confirmed fix works, so will be merging and releasing this off of the `helm2` branch.
