This is evidenced by this build log in our testing:

```
msg="Upgrading current deployed
version of coredns
(602401143452.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/eks/coredns:v1.8.4-eksbuild.1)
to match expected version
(602401143452.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/eks/coredns:v1.8.3-eksbuild.1)."
```
