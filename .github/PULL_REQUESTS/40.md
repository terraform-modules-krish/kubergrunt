# Support passing in tls subject info as json

**yorinasub17** commented *Apr 11, 2019*

This introduces a new command line argument for tls called `--tls-subject-json`. The goal of this CLI arg is to allow the user to provide the TLS subject info params (e.g `--tls-common-name`) in a JSON format.

The motivation for doing this is to simplify the terraform parsing logic here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-kubernetes-helm/blob/master/dependencies.tf#L9
