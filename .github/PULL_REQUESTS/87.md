# Add Kubernetes authentication option based on EKS

**yorinasub17** commented *Mar 26, 2020*

This introduces a new authentication scheme for `kubergrunt`, where you can provide an EKS cluster ARN. In this auth scheme, we will do the following:

- Obtain a temporary authentication token from EKS for the k8s API.
- Create a new temp file to act as a kubeconfig file.
- Setup the default context in the temp kubeconfig to point to the EKS kubernetes API.
- Setup the default context in the temp kubeconfig file to use the auth token pulled down in step 1.

This allows you to do something like the following without setting up the kubeconfig with `eks configure`:

```
kubergrunt k8s kubectl --kubectl-eks-cluster-arn $EKS_CLUSTER_ARN -- get pods -n kube-system
```

Thanks for review. Will merge after doing integration testing in the EKS repo.

Ok ran through some regression testing in the EKS repo, found a few bugs, but now this is fixed and working so going to merge + release. Thanks for review!
