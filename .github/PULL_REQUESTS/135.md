# Address case when there is more than one TargetGroup

**yorinasub17** commented *Aug 17, 2021*

Fixes https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt/issues/133

The issue is that I had the mistaken assumption that NLBs will always only have one target group when managed by k8s, but this is not true. When there are multiple ports on a single Service, k8s manifests that as multiple listeners that each have their own target groups. This addresses that case by waiting until all target groups have the instances registered.

NOTE: I have verified this works from a test setup in `terraform-aws-eks`. ~The related integration test branch will be pushed momentarily...~ Integration testing branch is available here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks/pull/351
