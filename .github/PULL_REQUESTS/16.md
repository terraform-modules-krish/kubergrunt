# Allow specifying different TLS identifiers for the client

**yorinasub17** commented *Feb 1, 2019*

In implementing https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt/pull/14, I overlooked a bug where I reused the `TLSOptions` of the server side config. This is not good, because then the client certificate isn't actually unique since it is the same identifier as the Tiller server!

This fixes that by adding in new options to use to configure the client TLS certificate and passing it through.

Thanks for the fast review @rileykarson . I also realized I should add a regression test so adding that now.
