## Description

We are already able to sign the binaries of internal projects, like [patcher-cli](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/patcher-cli/releases) and [terrapatch-cli](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terrapatch-cli).

I am replicating the same process in kubergrunt, the MacOS binaries will be signed and notarized before generating the `sha256sum`.
