# Add support for syncing components of k8s 1.18

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 20, 2020*

This adds support for Kubernetes version 1.18 to the `sync-core-components` command. Note that there was a config deprecation in `coredns` with `1.7.0`, which is the version that is deployed with k8s 1.18. This adds the logic to handle that.

See https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/1115 for more details.
