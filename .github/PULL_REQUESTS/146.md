# Dynamically set the max size to the necessary capacity during rollout

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 6, 2021*

This addresses a limitation with the current deployment rollout, where it is dependent on the `max_size` being set to a sufficiently large capacity. However, for certain use cases, this is undesirable as the `max_size` and `min_size` may be used to force the ASG capacity.

For example, some modules (including our EKS module) want to set the `auto_scaling_group` resource to `ignore_changes` on the `desired_capacity` to allow for use of the `cluster-autoscaler`. Users who want to use the same module without cluster-autoscaler must set the `min_size` and `max_size` to be the equivalent value to control the cluster size. For these use cases, having `kubergrunt` dynamically update the ASG `max_size` is desirable. Note that this also works for use cases with the `cluster-autoscaler`, where the `desired_capacity` may be set at values closer to the `max_size` during scale out events.

As always, testing for this functionality is done through `gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks`. [terraform-aws-eks Test PR Link](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks/pull/363)

Thanks for review! Going to merge this in so we can cut a release for the customer, but will open a follow up PR to address the nit.
