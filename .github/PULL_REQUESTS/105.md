# Bug fix infinite retry case

**yorinasub17** commented *Dec 16, 2020*

This fixes a bug in the cleanup routine that did not handle successfully detached network interfaces correctly. The bug was due to the ordering of the cases.

Specifically, the original implementation had a function named `isNIDetachedErr` to check if the NI was already detached. Because of the way it was named, it was placed in the secondary switch case after the `err==nil` check. However, in reality the function was checking if `err==nil` and checking the status. But because the `err==nil` check to retry the loop was earlier in the `switch` statement, you would never enter the `isNIDetachedErr` case when `err==nil`, making that an impossible case to satisfy.

To make it easier to follow, this refactors the switch statement to distinctly call out that `isNIDetached` function should be called when `err==nil`. Otherwise, as implemented, it is too easy for someone looking at this code in isolation to "optimize" the switch case and bring the `err==nil` case first.

For reference, we ran into this in the service catalog test: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/gruntwork-io/aws-service-catalog/3112/workflows/213b5fef-f908-424b-95f0-71dab06742d3/jobs/3356

UPDATE: Added some basic unit tests for the functionality so we don't have to always go through EKS - 6326fd6
