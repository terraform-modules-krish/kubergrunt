# Introduce `eks sync-core-components` subcommand

**yorinasub17** commented *Sep 21, 2020*

This implements the logic in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/update-cluster.html , which we currently use a python script baked in the EKS module for. By moving the logic to `kubergrunt`, we not only make the module more flexible (e.g., you don't need to update to latest version everytime a new k8s version is released), but the logic can also be used with other methods of launching EKS, including the open source tf module.

See https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks/issues/174 for more details.

NOTE: there are no tests for the command because it is expensive to launch and manage an EKS cluster. Instead, we rely on our EKS repo for integration testing.

The related integration testing is being done here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks/pull/206

Thanks for review! Merging and releasing now!

> Sorry that I missed the re-review notice!

No worries! This wasn't urgent anyway. I was going to have fun to see how long it would take by repeating `ping` and `pong` every week.
