# Convenience command to retrieve OIDC Issuer thumbprint

**yorinasub17** commented *Sep 13, 2019*

Currently setting up the IAM Role for Service Accounts feature in Terraform is a bit of a pain because there is no easy way to retrieve the OIDC issuer thumbprint for setting up the provider. This adds the functionality into `kubergrunt` so that it can be used as an external data source:

```
resource "aws_eks_cluster" "example" {
  # ... other configuration ...
}

data "external" "oidc_thumbprint" {
  program = ["kubergrunt", "eks", "oidc-thumbprint", "--issuer-url", aws_eks_cluster.example.identity.0.oidc.0.issuer]
}

resource "aws_iam_openid_connect_provider" "example" {
  client_id_list  = ["sts.amazonaws.com"]
  thumbprint_list = [data.external.oidc_thumbprint.result.thumbprint]
  url             = "${aws_eks_cluster.example.identity.0.oidc.0.issuer}"
}
```
