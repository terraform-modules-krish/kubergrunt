# Add DNS Names to certificate Subject Alternative Name

**KyleMartin901** commented *Oct 6, 2019*

DNS Names in the Subject Alternative Name are required when calling a service via its DNS name. This is needed when tools like [FluxCD Helm Operator](https://github.com/fluxcd/helm-operator) as they comunicate with Tiller via its service rather than using portforwarding like the Helm client.

Even though Tiller will most likly only require a single DNS name entry I have added the ability to add multiple DNS names so this tool can create certificates for other applications that will require more than a single DNS name. To add more than a single DNS entry you pass in the flag `--tls-dns-name` multiple times with the required DNS names.

Example:

```
tls gen \
--namespace tiller \
--ca-secret-name tiller-namespace-tiller-ca-certs \
--ca-namespace kube-system
--secret-name tiller-tiller-certs \
--tls-dns-name tiller-deploy.tiller \
--tls-dns-name tiller-deploy.gruntwork.io \
--tls-common-name gruntwork.io \
--tls-org Gruntwork
```

This will fix #67
