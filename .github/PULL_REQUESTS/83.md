# Handle internal load balancers

**yorinasub17** commented *Mar 10, 2020*

This fixes a bug where internal load balancers were not handled correctly, due to them having a different naming scheme.

**NOTE**: Since this is with the rolling deployment feature, this can only be tested with an EKS cluster. For maintenance reasons, the integration tests with EKS is handled in our `terraform-aws-eks` repo. See https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks/pull/123 for the integration testing.
