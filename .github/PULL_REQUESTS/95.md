# Remove helm; switch to go modules; bump dependencies

**yorinasub17** commented *Sep 19, 2020*

__Depends on https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-ci/pull/235__

Fixes https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt/issues/94

Fixing this required switching to go modules, but this had a yak where the `helm` package was not compatible due to the `helm` repo not supporting go modules until v3.

To work around this, this removes the deprecated `helm` command now that there is [a clear EOL date for helm v2](https://helm.sh/blog/helm-v2-deprecation-timeline/).

I also needed to bump dependencies (specifically `client-go` and related kubernetes packages) to the versions that support go modules.

EKS test passed: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks/987/workflows/95078656-84b1-4f12-b4b9-157744643e0b/jobs/4422/steps

The one test failure is because of running out of VPCs in our account.
