# Kubergrunt updates to help define an alternative Tiller deployment setup

**yorinasub17** commented *Apr 30, 2019*

This makes two changes:

### tls gen

This updates the `tls gen` command to use the new way of authenticating to Kubernetes (specifically passing in server and token info directly) and using JSON to configure the TLS subject.


### helm wait-for-tiller

This introduces a new command `helm wait-for-tiller` which can be used to wait for a tiller deployment to roll out Pods, and have at least one Pod that can be pinged. This enables chaining calls to helm after helm is deployed when using a different helm deployment process that doesn't rely on the helm client (e.g creating deployment resources manually).
