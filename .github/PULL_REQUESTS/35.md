# Implementation of tls gen command

**yorinasub17** commented *Mar 21, 2019*

This implements the `tls gen` subcommand documented in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt/pull/34.

As part of this, there was a few things I had to refactor:

- Migrated the TLS CLI args to `cmd/common.go` so I can reuse it for the tls command.
- Moved test helpers and functions around to where they thematically make more sense. Specifically, the `StoreCertificateKeyPairAsKubernetesSecret` felt like it belonged more in the `tls` module.
