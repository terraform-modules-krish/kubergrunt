# Increase cleanup timeout to 5 minutes

**rhoboat** commented *Dec 10, 2020*

Even though the terraform-aws-eks tests are passing on CI, when running the cleanup steps locally, increasing the timeout may help. I'm able to see that the cleanup does eventually resolve, but takes several tries. This PR increases the total timeout to 5 minutes, up from 2 minutes.
