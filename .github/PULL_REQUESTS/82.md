# Set ServerName for tls config

**yorinasub17** commented *Mar 2, 2020*

Fix bug where getting the OIDC thumbprint fails because the tls config is missing the `ServerName`.

Integration testing results https://circleci.com/gh/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks/2560

Note that there is one test failure, but it is unrelated to this change.

The thing that was really confusing to me (and the reason I hadn't yet submitted a PR) is that this working at all in the first place. Shouldn't the error occur every time? Why is it intermittent?

Let me run this a few times more to see if it still happens on this fix.

> Why is it intermittent?

I don't have concrete data on this, but my guess is that it has to do with the fact that the endpoint is asynchronously created. That is, EKS will provision this endpoint sometime after the cluster is up, and the `kubergrunt` routine fails or succeeds based on whether or not that endpoint is fully provisioned. What I don't know is if it fails when the endpoint is not available, or if it fails when it is. But since this is a nondeterministic failure in a long cycle time, it's a bit difficult to know fully...

Ah I am an idiot ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ I did the integration testing release against master, not this branch, so the old test results are moot.

Recreated release against this branch. Will trigger another test cycle with that...

Ok I verified after a few more runs that we are no longer seeing this issue after this fix: https://circleci.com/gh/gruntwork-io/workflows/terraform-aws-eks/tree/yori-investigate-fluentdirsa

Since it doesn't hurt, I'm going to go ahead and merge + release this.

Thanks for the review and sanity check!
