Also drops k8s 1.15 and 1.14, which is deprecated by EKS.

Thanks for review! I'll hold off on merge until the integration tests pass in `terraform-aws-eks` (https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks/pull/324)

Ok the integration test had some errors, but it is unrelated to this change, so will merge and release!
