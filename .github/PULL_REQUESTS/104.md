[Test run on terraform-aws-eks](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks/1270/workflows/505c8244-9b25-476d-8cbb-8d6006cb65d4/jobs/5936/artifacts) revealed a bug in the logic in our cleanup. This attempts to fix that.

The bug was that we were throwing errors that the ENI was NotFound, from within `requestDetach`, when actually, we have a place that catches that error in the calling function:

Got it! I think we are saying the same thing.
