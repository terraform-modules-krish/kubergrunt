# Add new functionality to cordon and drain nodes in an ASG

**yorinasub17** commented *May 6, 2021*

This introduces a new command `kubergrunt eks drain` which can be used to cordon and drain all the instances in an ASG. This is useful when doing a blue-green replacement of the worker pools.

NOTE: Because this is related to EKS, there is no testing in this repo. Instead, we have integration testing in the `terraform-aws-eks` repo. Here is the PR: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks/pull/319
