## Description

This PR updates the `eks sync-core-components` command to add support for k8s version 1.22. This also removes support for 1.18, 1.17, and 1.16, which [has reached end of support in EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html#kubernetes-release-calendar).

I also went ahead and synced the version of vpc CNI to the one advertised on the EKS page. Note that as a result of this, I had to simplify the `GetBaseURL` routine - the VPC CNI config is now simplified to not include the major-minor version of CNI. See https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s/tree/master/config

Thanks for review! There are still issues with using k8s 1.22 in `terraform-aws-eks`, but they are unrelated to this command and the test steps using this command passed, so will go ahead and merge this in!
