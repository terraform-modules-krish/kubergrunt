# Always enable AWS shared configuration file support

**jtdoepke** commented *Apr 27, 2021*

Similar to what Hashicorp has done in Terraform (https://github.com/hashicorp/aws-sdk-go-base/pull/38), always enable AWS shared configuration file support. This way the `AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG` env var no longer needs to be set to use named profiles.
