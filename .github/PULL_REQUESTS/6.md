# helm deploy

This implements the `helm deploy` sub command. This command:

- Generates a CA certificate key pair for this deployment of helm. This CA is used to trust the server certificate, as well as the clients.
- Store the CA key pair in a Kubernetes secret in the `kube-system` namespace.
- Generate a signed certificate key pair using the CA from ^. This certificate key pair will be used for the deployed tiller server.
- Deploy a Helm server with TLS verification enabled, in the provided namespace with the provided service account. This also updates the configuration to setup Tiller to store its metadata in a `Secret` as opposed to `ConfigMaps`.

Additional bonus yak shaves:

- Add a `TLSOptions` struct that acts as the interface to the `tls` library. This will select the right underlying functions for generating certificate key pairs with the different TLS algorithms.
- Add a function for executing `helm` commands.
- Add a function for loading certificates and keys from disk.
