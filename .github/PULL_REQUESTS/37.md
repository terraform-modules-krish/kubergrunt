# EKS token as data source

**yorinasub17** commented *Apr 6, 2019*

This introduces a new parameter to the `eks token` command that makes the command suitable for use as a terraform external data source. Specifically, this works around the limitation where the data source expects outputs to be in a flat map, encoded as JSON. The token output is in JSON, but the actual token data is nested in another map. Since we only need the actual token output and not the metadata in this mode of use, this command simply extracts out the token and puts it in a flat map of one attribute `token_data`.
