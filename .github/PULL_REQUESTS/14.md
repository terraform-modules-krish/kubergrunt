# Local client configure on deploy

**yorinasub17** commented *Jan 31, 2019*

This adds additional optional flags to `helm deploy` so that you can grant and configure the local client in one step as part of the deploy.

This also additionally copies in the helm docs from `terraform-kubernetes-helm` so that that is available here as well as a reference.

UPDATE: I made one more change 900a0e7 

Instead of using a `label` to store the RBAC entity on the client certs, I switched to using an `annotation`. The difference is that `label`s are indexed for lookups, while `annotations` are not. I did this because:

- You would most likely do a name lookup if you have the rbac entity name instead of a label lookup
- `label`s have the same restrictions as a name, which is that you can't have special characters (other than `_` and `.`) but rbac entity names like group and user can (e.g `system:master`).

Merging and releasing.
