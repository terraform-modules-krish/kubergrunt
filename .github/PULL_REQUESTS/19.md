# Document how kubergrunt addresses the security best practices of Tiller

**yorinasub17** commented *Feb 2, 2019*

I realized the root README is too focused on the individual commands and don't really address the security best practices directly, so I decided to add a specific section in the Helm Guide that talks about how `kubergrunt` addresses the security best practices of Tiller.

Would be great to get a sanity check on whether what I am saying actually makes sense.

Ok @brikis98 I can use another review of the guide as I rewrote the entire kubergrunt section to avoid being redundant with the root README.

> Do we have equivalent docs that walk you through the entire process of setting up K8S? E.g., "Use module X to deploy EKS/GKE, use kubergrunt to deploy tiller, use XXX to do YYY, start deploying your services as helm charts or via kubectl..."

Not yet, but it is on the radar.

Merging this for now. The next iteration on this guide will be https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt/issues/20
