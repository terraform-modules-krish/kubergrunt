# Add support for Kubernetes 1.19

**FriedCircuits** commented *Feb 23, 2021*

Per https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt/issues/111 I am adding support for EKS Kubernetes 1.19. I was able to upgrade a cluster with these changes. 

I used the versions in this chart.

Thanks for the contribution! This looks good to me. Will kick off a build, and if it passes, we can merge this in.
