# Fix bug where helm home differed between client configuration and init

**yorinasub17** commented *Feb 2, 2019*

This is another bug I found during integration testing of https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt/pull/14 in `terraform-kubernetes-helm`. Now that we are passing in `helmHome` to `Deploy` as part of client configuration, the `helm init` call should point to that `helmHome` directory so that it initializes it correctly.
