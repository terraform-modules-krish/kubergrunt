# Grant ability to get the Tiller Deployment

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 8, 2019*

This fixes an issue with using `helm grant` as the sole method to grant the minimal permissions for accessing tiller when using with [the terraform helm provider](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-helm).

Terraform helm provider attempts to retrieve the `Deployment` resource of Tiller to verify that is up before attempting to connect to it. Previously we did not grant enough permissions for that operation: this PR fixes that.

Note: This was confirmed working with our EKS deployments by @mcalhoun.
