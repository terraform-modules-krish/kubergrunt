# Look for the latest eksbuild version to use for each region

Fixes https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt/issues/136

This PR addresses the issue by looking for the latest available `eksbuild` tag to use given a component tag base. I opted for doing it this way instead of relying on the component version table in the AWS docs because there is a `eksbuild.2` release in `us-east-1` for these components, suggesting that the version to use will be different depending on which region you are in.
