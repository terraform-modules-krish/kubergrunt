# Add unit tests for eksbuild tag finder

**yorinasub17** commented *Aug 20, 2021*

This adds unit tests for the feature merged with https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt/pull/137

NOTE: Earlier today, I launched an EKS cluster on `us-east-1` and definitely saw it use `eksbuild.2` for kubernetes version 1.18, but just now I checked and it was using `eksbuild.1`. AWS must have rolled it back or something because it is odd for it to suddenly go missing. In any case, I still think having this eksbuild lookup feature is useful because it will be robust to changes as EKS rolls out patches of their own.
