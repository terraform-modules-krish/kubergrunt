# Add helm revoke functionality: build on #50

**yorinasub17** commented *May 28, 2019*

This implements small refactored improvements on https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt/pull/50 so that it can be merged:

- Moved placement of error types so that they are in `helm/errors.go`
- Removed `RevocationErrors` since it turned out to be redundant with `MultiHelmError`.
- Refactored call to `revokeAccessFromRBACEntity`: Instead of calling it for each entity type (RBAC Group, User, and ServiceAccount), we build the entity list first and call it once. This works better with the error handling using `MultiHelmError`.
- Reword some error messages so that it is clearer what is going on.
- Removed all the overrides in the dependency list, as they are now resolved from the later versions of kube. Upgraded terratest to latest and fixed build failures.

Going to merge this in now that build is passing, since it is building on heavily reviewed code, with a few minor improvements.
