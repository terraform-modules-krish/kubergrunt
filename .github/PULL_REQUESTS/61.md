# Create the golang binary in seperate bin directory

**sayanchowdhury** commented *Aug 19, 2019*

This patch updates the README file to create the kubergrunt binary within a bin
directory and adds the folder to gitignore to not let git track the folder.

This is just a suggestion PR which I thought while setting up the project.
