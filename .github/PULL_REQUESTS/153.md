# Update CODEOWNERS to reflect latest owners

**yorinasub17** commented *Nov 30, 2021*

NOTE: I originally had the codeowners officially only be me, but have a team section so I know who to route requests to, but in the new world with contractors and team owners, it no longer makes sense to adopt that model so I am officially setting all the current SMEs as code owners.

Ah, ok. I updated the `CODEOWNERS` with `github-watcher.py` and that just seemed to append to the end of the file. This applies to other repos / PRs, as well but you seem to have issued new PRs for those.
