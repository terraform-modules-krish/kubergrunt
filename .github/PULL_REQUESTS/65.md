# Make sure to cordon all the nodes in a rotation

**yorinasub17** commented *Sep 13, 2019*

Fixes https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt/issues/64. Otherwise, Pods may reschedule on existing nodes and trigger thrashing during the drain procedure.

**Note**: Testing will be done in the Gruntwork IaC `terraform-aws-eks` module. A temporary integration testing release will be cut with branch that the module will reference for testing.
