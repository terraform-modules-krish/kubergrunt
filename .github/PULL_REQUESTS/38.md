# Direct Auth via CLI

**yorinasub17** commented *Apr 10, 2019*

This implements support for passing in authentication information via the command line as opposed to using a kubeconfig, complementing the previous feature of supporting the EKS token as a data source (https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt/pull/37).

With these changes, now everything in `kubergrunt` can be done without configuring `kubectl`.
