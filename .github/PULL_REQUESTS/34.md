# RDD for TLS cert management

**yorinasub17** commented *Mar 21, 2019*

This is the RDD for a new command `tls gencert`. This command is a generic TLS management tool that uses Kubernetes `Secrets` as its secret manager.

The specific use case this fulfills is [managing TLS certs for kiam](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/blob/master/docs/TLS.md). However, it appears the pattern kiam uses is generic, and thus it is possible this has other use cases.

NOTE: Since most of the backend is implemented in the `tls` module of `kubergrunt` already, I will be diving into the implementation right away, but would love CLI design feedback despite that.
