# NLB based loadbalancer service support in eks deploy

**yorinasub17** commented *Aug 11, 2021*

Fixes https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt/issues/114

This also fixes error handling from `kubectl drain` and `kubectl cordon` commands that I noticed in testing.

Note that there is limited unit testing for these functions due to the amount of effort required in setting up the test case. Instead, we rely on integration testing from our `terraform-aws-eks` repo.

Thanks for review! The integration tests passed as well. Going to hold off merge until I get confirmation from the customer that this solves their issue as well.

Customer expressed getting a released version than a test version. I have reasonable confidence works given the local repro and test validation, so going to merge and release this.
