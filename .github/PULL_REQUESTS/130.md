> NIT: On the whole, I wonder about these updates scaling. I like that these two new update...Compatibility functions are named for both the version and the thing being updated.

I don't think we should worry too much about this. EKS is only going to maintain support for a handful of kubernetes versions (as evidenced by the fact that they continue to roll off the oldest version everytime they add support for a new version). And the number of versions that need special treatment will be even less than that.

Furthermore, this command is going to be deprecated real soon when we switch to using managed add-ons, which will encapsulate this logic at the AWS API level.

Can you elaborate what you are thinking here? I don't think I fully understand what you are proposing here. I'm having a hard time figuring out how you can reduce the checks down to a single `semverStringCompare` given the number of path ways that one updates their kubernetes cluster (and thus you can end up with needing to run both updates because you are hopping from <1.7.0 to >1.8.3).

Thanks for the review! I'm waiting on the integration testing build to pass before merging this in.

Good question. I was thinking the way to know which (how many) updates to apply would be derived from the difference in versions. ðŸ¤” I am not sure if that's possible. I think the `.Compare` function might only return `-1, 0, 1`.

Wouldn't that be much more confusing as a maintainer? E.g., you now have to do the math to update the `-N` number everytime a new backward incompatible update is released.

Ok integration testing branch passed, so will go ahead and merge this in! Thanks for the review!
