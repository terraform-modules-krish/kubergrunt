> One thing I am wondering though, do you think it makes sense to change [this](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt/blob/main/kubectl/config.go#L114) from `v1beta1` to `v1`? I don't think it's necessary since only `alpha` was dropped, but something we might want to consider (or at least backlog it for the next release bump).

I think `v1` was introduced in `1.22`, so changing it would drop support to versions below that. We can keep it as it is, but definitely keep this in mind for future releases.
