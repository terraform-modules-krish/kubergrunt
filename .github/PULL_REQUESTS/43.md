# Add command for waiting for ingress endpoint

**yorinasub17** commented *Apr 25, 2019*

One of the annoying things about Kubernetes is the asynchronous nature of how many things happen. This is especially true with EKS, where resources like `Ingress` depend on AWS resources (ALB) to provision. This means a lot of waiting is involved and there aren't a lot of commands in `kubectl` that support things like waiting for the Ingress endpoint to be available.

Naturally, it makes sense for us to provide this kind of support in `kubergrunt`. This is the first attempt: this one is for waiting for the Ingress endpoint to be provisioned.
