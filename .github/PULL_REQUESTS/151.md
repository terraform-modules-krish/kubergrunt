## Description
Previously, the EKS add-on container image account was hard coded to a single account ID. However, [in some regions, the account ID differs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/add-ons-images.html). This update adjusts the ECR repo URL to work in those regions.

Integration tests passed. [See passing test here.](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks/1646/workflows/4cae3e70-41e6-4740-bba3-59f679de2dc5/jobs/7777)

> Cut an alpha release (I typically use v0.0.0-alpha.1, pointing to the PR branch, and marked as pre-release).

Note, in order to pass the [minimum version check](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks/blob/c115b99fe949402cb7b4e7d415d20ad2969d89ce/modules/eks-cluster-control-plane/scripts/find_and_run_kubergrunt.py#L71) I set the tag to `v0.7.11-alpha`.
